# THE IOT LIBRARY #

**The ilog class is a C++ logger class for storing sensor data.**

The class has two constructors that take an unsigned integer for the 
length of the array and an enumeration type flag that specifies the 
type of data stored in the array (NUM or WRD)

***ilog::max_length*** returns the maximum length of the array that can 
be created.
