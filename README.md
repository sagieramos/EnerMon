# **EnerMon - Smart Energy Monitor and Control System**
*Empowering Energy Efficiency*

## Introduction ##

EnerMon is a smart energy monitoring and control system that helps households and small businesses to manage their energy consumption more efficiently. The system provides real-time data on energy consumption and offers intelligent recommendations on how to reduce energy wastage. EnerMon is built on the latest IoT technologies and is designed to be user-friendly, affordable, and customizable.

## Technologies ##
**Libraries:**

Node.js, Socket.io, InfluxDB and Protocol buffer.

**Language:**

C/C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

**Frameworks:** 

PlatformIO, Bootstrap.

**Communication Protocol:**

HyperText Transfer Protocol and Websocket.

**Hardware:**

Expressif32, PZEM-004T and AC-DC converter circuit.

## Trade-offs ##

Processing power: The ESP32 is a 32-bit microcontroller and has a dual-core Tensilica LX6 processor, which runs at up to 240 MHz. This dual-core processor allows for multitasking and handling more complex tasks. Each core has 32 KB of instruction and data cache memory. However, most Arduino are 32-bit microcontrollers which run at most 16 Mhz.

Connectivity: The ESP32 has built-in WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity, which makes it easy to connect to other devices and networks. Most Arduino boards do not have built-in connectivity.

## Challenges ##

The problem that EnerMon is intended to solve is the inefficiency of energy consumption in households and small businesses. EnerMon provides real-time data on energy consumption and offers intelligent recommendations on how to reduce energy wastage.

However, EnerMon does not solve the problem of renewable energy adoption or energy storage. EnerMon only helps to monitor and control energy consumption, but it does not provide any renewable energy solutions.

The users of EnerMon are households and small businesses that want to manage their energy consumption more efficiently. EnerMon helps them to reduce their energy bills, lower their carbon footprint, and contribute to a more sustainable future.

## Infrastructure ##

Branching and merging among team's and future contributors repositories will follow the Gitflow strategy, which separates development and production branches and uses feature and release branches for development and testing. 

For testing EnerMon, we will use a combination of manual and automated testing. Manual testing will involve testing the user interface and user experience of EnerMon to ensure that it is user-friendly and intuitive. Automated testing will involve using tools such as Jest and Enzyme to test the functionality and performance of the system, as well as conducting integration and end-to-end testing to ensure that all components are working together as intended.
